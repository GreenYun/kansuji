// Package kansuji provides kansuji conversion.
//
// The "kansuji" is the romanization form of japanese "漢数字", which has the same
// meaning of Chinese "中文數字" ("中文数字", means Chinese number). As a matter of
// fact, these numbers have been used originally by Chinese for thousands of years.
// The reason to use "kansuji" was just for simple and short.
//
// In the age of Ming dynasty, the Hongwu Emperor (Chu Yuan-chang) has forced the
// domestic financial system to use the financial style numbers, which are Chinese
// characters with lots of strokes, that can hardly be modified, compared to the
// very simple characters originally stand for numbers.
//
// This package supports both forms of kansuji.
