Package kansuji provides kansuji conversion.

The "kansuji" is the romanization form of japanese "漢数字", which has the same meaning of Chinese "中文數字" ("中文数字", means Chinese number). As a matter of fact, these numbers have been used originally by Chinese for thousands of years. The reason to use "kansuji" was just for simple and short.

In the age of Ming dynasty, the Hongwu Emperor (Chu Yuan-chang) has forced the domestic financial system to use the financial style numbers, which are Chinese characters with lots of strokes, that can hardly be modified, compared to the very simple characters originally stand for numbers. This package supports both forms of kansuji.
